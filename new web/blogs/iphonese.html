					<h2>What is the main reason that Apple announce a not so innovative iPhone?</h2>
					<p>
						During the announcement of iPhone SE, Apple gave us two reasons for why publishing iPhone SE, however, none of those was the main reason. The main reason that Apple didn’t tell you is. iPhone SE was specifically designed for Chinses Market. Here are two supporting evidence. First, if you watched the Apple Special Event, you probably noticed that the speaker mentioned China as a market twice during the release of iPhone SE, on the other hand when it comes to the iPad pro, the speaker didn't even talk about Chinese Market. Why? Is it because Chinese customers don't use iPad? Definitely not, in China, pretty much every middle and higher level families have at least one iPad. Thus, we can conclude that iPad Pro is not targeting China but iPhone SE is. The reason behind this marketing strategy leads us to the second reason why I say iPhone is specifically designed for China.

					The second reason supporting that iPhone SE is for the Chinese market is that the selling of ios devices in China is decreasing. There are several reasons for that. China is the largest market where Apple make it profit after America. The main reason Chinese customers kept buying new iPhones is because Chinese customers love big brands and Apple happens to be a perfect brand representing luxury and can be used to show off on streets. However, in recent years, things changed. First, Chinese own brands start to rise and they are growing fast. In China, representatives such as Xiaomi and Huawei start to take over the market due to their very cheap price. In the oversea market, Chinese phones like Oneplus is making good selling as well. These phones are not only just cheap but also coming with good qualities. For instance, the latest Xiaomi phone MI5 is reviewed as "the biggest rival" by Forbes. I got my first Xiaomi MI2 in 2012, back then there was nobody using Xiaomi. You can see iPhone or Samsung everywhere, but last summer when I got back to China again. 80% of the people on the street or on buses are staring at their Xiaomi phones. But don't people buy iPhone to show off? Yes, they still do. But only a small part of them. Taking a look at the Chinese market, two type of customers buying phones. Young people and older people. For young people, their parents would agree more if they want a $300 Xiaomi instead of a $1000 iPhone. Also, they want Xiaomi more since all of their friends are using Xiaomi phones as well. Second reason, there is almost no difference for what an iPhone can do compare with what an Android phone can do. Several years ago, iPhone was leading the trend of smartphones. iPhone started to use fingerprints, and every other phone follows. iPhone started to use USB-C port, every other phone follows. But today, iPhone is no longer innovative or leading the trend anymore. It seems to me after Steve Jobs was gone, Apple lost its soul. Whether Apple has lost its innovations or not still needs to be determined, because every time Apple release a new iPhone, it would not have all the latest innovations. This is a very understandable market strategy, they can make more money if every new release comes with a little improvement rather than big change. Maybe Apple is still very innovative and is hiding some special technology that would change the world again, they just haven't released them yet. We shall see after the announcement of iPhone 7.

					<h2>Is the announcement of IPhoneSE a sign of Apple going downhill?</h2>
					<p>
						According to the previous analysis, iPhone SE was not meant for something big. Its sole purpose is to take back the Chinese market it has lost. Would it be successful? My personal opinion, Yes. Why, because this time it cost almost the same as other Chinese brand smartphones and it has an Apple logo on it. Also, it is too hard to buy Xiaomi phones even within China. So this release will be a good hit for Chinese brand phones. About if Apple is going down, after the release of iPhone SE, the stock price of Apple dropped, but it doesn't actually mean Apple is going down. Just as analyzed previously, iPhone SE is just a "normal" product for markets, not for innovations, which means it cannot be treated as an innovative iPhone product.  From my perspective, it shouldn't even be counted into iPhone family. We shall only see where Apple is going after its announcement of iPhone 7, by then we will be able to see if Apple has lost its soul.

					<h3>Other questions:</h3>
					<p>
						<h4>Why does iPhone SE specification have nothing surprising?</h4> 
						As I analyzed, it’s for the market, not for a big update like iPhone 7. So of course no big innovation. But it is a new phone anyway so it has to use the latest chips.
						<br/><h4>Why 4-inch?</h4>
						On the one hand, it can control the cost, on the other hand, it comes with perks for those who like small iPhones. Also, they need to distinguish between two iPhone lines. iPhone 6 or 7 are like the star products while iPhone SE is just a normal product.
