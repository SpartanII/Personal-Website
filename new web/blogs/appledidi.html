						Several weeks after the Apple invested $1 billon dollars to Didi and Tim Cook visited China, I decided to summarize the potential reasons I collected from the internet behind this investment and give some opinion of my own about what I think about this investment.
					</p>

					<h2>Potential reasons for Apple to invest in Didi:</h2>
					<h3>1. For Apple Pay Service</h3>
					<p>
						...it could be good news for Apple Pay in China, a distant competitor to Alibaba’s Alipay...It gives their users another reason to use Apple wallet,” says Chi Tsang, an HSBC analyst in Hong Kong... <br/>--From <a href="http://fortune.com/2016/05/13/uber-apple-china-didi/">FORTUNE</a>
					</p>
					<h3>I rate it: ☆ NOT LIKELY</h3>
					<p>
						Apple Pay is very different from Alipay or Wechat Pay in China. Apple pay is not an online payment, actually it is an offline payment system using NFC in your iphone for pos machines. For services provided by Didi, it is more likely that people would pay by online system like Alipay or Wechat since it is quite unlikely for every Didi driver to have pos machine or a hardware device to support Apply Pay in their car. With online payment system, a customer can make the transaction as long as s/he has internet access which is the best solution for business like Didi.

					<h3>2. For political reasons</h3>
					<p>
						...So by making a $1 billion investment in Didi, Apple is basically sending a strong message that its interests are aligned with those of Beijing — and that should help it stay in China's favor, at least for awhile...  <br/>--From <a href="http://www.techinsider.io/apple-investment-in-didi-chuxing-is-political-2016-5">TechInsider</a>
					</p>
					<h3>I rate it: ☆☆☆ MAY NOT WORK</h3>
					<p>
						I don’t comment on political matters, but I don’t think it will help Apple anyway. If just $1billion dollars is enough for Apple to open some market for its service, Facebook would have done so already. Going back history, every field of business Chinese government protected worth billions of dollars. Take Facebook as an example, if Facebook was allowed in China, there would be no Tencent or Tencent wouldn’t be as giant as it is today. This means China would have lost one of the several billion dollar companies. Chinese government is no fool, so this investment may not be able to help Apple is the market is what Tim Cook wanted.

					<h3>3. For better sales for iphone</h3>
					<p>
						Pretty much every blog mentioned about this...
					</p>
					<h3>I rate it: ☆☆☆☆ HOW?</h3>
					<p>
						This is like use Uber to sell iphone, it sounds ridiculous, I don't know how Apple will be able to do this. But there is something I have noticed that will lead us to the next point. I will talk briefly about what I think here. In order to see what Apple really wants, I downloaded the Didi Chuxing App on my phone, and I found somthing interesing. On Didi Chuxing, there are 5 different types of rides user can choose, and they are classified by the amount of money required for each sort of services. This means Didi has the data of how much percent of population have a high level income(those who often choose fasted and more expensive rides) as well as the amount of people that are not so rich. This data can help Apple make the corresponding market strategies for different levels of Chinese customers just like how they designed IPhone SE for low income Chinese customers with a low price. But this will simply rise another issue, Apple is seen as a luxury company in China, if Apple lower its price for IPhone, its value will be lowered as long in Chinese customers' eyes. And this could potentially result in less people wanting to buy iphones. What would Apple do?

					<h3>4. For the data</h3>
					<p>
						Most of the wesbite on the internet are talking about how Apple can use these data for its own driverless car technology. I raised another potential usage for the data that Apple can use in last point. However, there are a few questions about this point.
					</p>
					<h3>I rate it: ☆☆☆☆☆ LIKELY</h3>
					<p>
						a.	How much data can Apple gain?<br/>
						I believe transportation is the next big thing. No matter it is as big as a super fast train Hyperloop or as small as a Xiaomi Scooter or it is the driverless car technology we are talking about, a lot of companies are try to change the way we transport. Also, there are a lot of problems that is yet to be solved in traffic, like dangerous car accidents or inevitable traffic jams. So there is no wonder for company as giant as Apple to step into the game. And spending $1billion for some data related to this problem would be very helpful, especially when Apple is developing its own driverless technology. BUT, how much data can Apple ‘buy’ by investing $1 billion dollars? Also why would Didi give some important data to Apple? Maybe Didi will share part of the data but how much would that be then? These are all the important questions. Here is another blog discussing about this problem.
						<br/>
						b.	Do Apple really have driveless technology? <br/>
						Even though Tim Cook hinted at the company’s electric car ambitions, we haven’t found out anything yet. You maybe thinking, how do we know about it? Here is the thing, if you want driverless car technology, you need to test it on the road. You can’t just hide the car in the Apple building and do the simulations, technology doesn’t work that way. If Apple is testing its driverless car, people would have found out something. Maybe someone would twitte “Oh look, this is Apple’s autonomous car, it is driving in California…”And later some media may claim that this is just a rumor. But people would have got something. Think about iphone7, to be honest, how many released pictures of iphone7 have you seen already? Even though it is a small mobile device, people manage to have a peek of it. Why would people not have info about something as big as a car? The walls have ears, if something is happening, we should be hearing it right now. Thus, the only explanation left is that Apple has not yet developed any usable prototype. Now the situation is simple, Apple is already one step behind Tesla, so it decided to get the data of the biggest market in the world and then try to catch up. What do you think?
